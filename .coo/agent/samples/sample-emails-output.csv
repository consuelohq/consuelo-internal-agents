alex.chen@techstartup.example,Alex,"Quick question about TechStartup's scaling","Hi Alex,

Saw your post about the microservices migration challenges at TechStartup - sounds like a significant undertaking, especially with the team growth post-Series A.

Curious how you're thinking about developer velocity during the transition? I've seen a few teams navigate this recently and noticed some patterns that might be relevant.

Happy to share if useful - no pitch, just observations from similar situations.

Michael from Acme mentioned you're doing interesting work scaling operations at GrowthCo.

I work with a few ops leaders facing similar growth challenges and thought there might be some overlap worth exploring.

Would a quick 15-min call make sense to see if there's fit?
