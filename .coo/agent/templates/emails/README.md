# Email Templates

> **NOTE**: These are example templates. Customize them for your business and brand.

## Template Structure

Each YAML file defines an email template with:

```yaml
name: template-name
subject: "Email subject line"
category: cold-outreach | follow-up | nurture | re-engagement
tone: professional | friendly | urgent | casual
structure:
  opening: "Opening line approach"
  body: "Main message structure"
  cta: "Call to action"
  closing: "Sign-off style"
variables:
  - first_name
  - company_name
  - pain_point
  - value_prop
```

## Categories

- **cold-outreach**: First contact with prospects
- **follow-up**: Following up on previous contact
- **nurture**: Building relationship over time
- **re-engagement**: Reconnecting with cold leads

## Customization

1. Edit templates to match your brand voice
2. Update variables to match your CRM fields
3. A/B test different approaches
4. Track which templates perform best

## Best Practices

- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Personalize with prospect-specific details
- Include clear call-to-action
- Test on mobile devices
