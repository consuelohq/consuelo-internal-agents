  Hi {{first_name}},

  Many {{industry}} teams I talk to mention {{pain_point}} as one of their
  biggest challenges right now.

  Curious if this resonates with what you're seeing at {{company_name}}?

  If so, happy to share what's working for similar teams - no pitch, just
  patterns I've noticed.

  {{your_name}}

tips:
  - Only use if you genuinely understand the problem
  - Be specific about the pain point
  - Position yourself as a peer, not a salesperson
  - The goal is to start a conversation
