  Hi {{first_name}},

  I'll keep this short - I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back,
  so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

  If {{value_summary}} ever becomes a priority, feel free to reach out.

  Wishing you and the team continued success.

  {{your_name}}

tips:
  - This often gets the highest response rate
