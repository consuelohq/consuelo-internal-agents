    "Step 1: Find the right prospects\n\n- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n- Filter by recent job changes, funding, or growth signals\n- Export to a spreadsheet\n\nQuality > Quantity always.",

    "Step 2: Research (5 min per prospect)\n\n- Their recent posts/content\n- Company news\n- Mutual connections\n- Tech stack (if relevant)\n\nFind ONE specific thing to reference.",

    "Step 3: Write the email\n\n- Subject: Short, relevant, no clickbait\n- Line 1: Personalized observation\n- Line 2-3: Why you're reaching out\n- Line 4: Clear ask (15-min call)\n\nKeep it under 100 words.",

    "Step 4: Follow up\n\n- Day 3: Bump with new value\n- Day 7: Different angle\n- Day 14: Breakup email\n\nMost replies come from follow-ups.",

    "Step 5: Track everything\n\n- Response rates by template\n- Best days/times\n- Which industries convert\n\nDouble down on what works.\n\nThat's the system.\n\nSave this thread and try it this week. 📌"
