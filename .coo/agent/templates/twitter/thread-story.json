    "3 years ago, I quit a $150k job to start a company with $0 in savings.\n\nEveryone thought I was crazy.\n\nHere's what actually happened 🧵",

    "Some context:\n\nI was 28, no kids, renting an apartment.\n\nI'd been thinking about starting something for 5 years.\n\nBut there was always a reason to wait.",

    "The trigger:\n\nMy manager rejected a project I'd worked on for 6 months.\n\nNot because it was bad. Because it 'wasn't a priority anymore.'\n\nI realized I'd never control my work inside a company.",

    "Month 1-3:\n\nI burned through my small savings fast.\n\nNo product. No customers. Just an idea.\n\nI picked up freelance work to survive.\n\n10 hour days minimum.",

    "The lowest point:\n\nMonth 4. $400 in my account.\n\nI almost called my old boss.\n\nInstead, I sent 50 cold emails offering consulting.\n\n3 replied. 1 became a $5k contract.",

    "The turning point:\n\nThat client introduced me to their network.\n\nWithin 2 months, I had more work than I could handle.\n\nI hired my first contractor.",

    "Month 12:\n\n- $180k revenue\n- 3 contractors\n- A real product in development\n- More fulfilled than ever\n\nNot wealthy. But free.",

    "3 years later:\n\nWe're a team of 8.\n\nThe company nearly died twice.\n\nBut I've never once regretted quitting.\n\nNot because of the money. Because of the ownership.",

    "The lesson:\n\nThere's never a 'right time.'\n\nIf you're waiting for certainty, you'll wait forever.\n\nThe best time to start is when you're scared but ready.\n\nWhat's the thing you've been putting off? 👇"
