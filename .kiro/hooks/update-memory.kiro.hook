Write a brief log entry with timestamp-style notes about what happened.\\n\\n2. If something is significant enough for long-term memory (a decision, a preference, a major project change), also update .kiro/steering/MEMORY.md (this is the steering file that gets injected into every session).\\n\\n3. If Ko corrected you on something, note it so you don't repeat the mistake.\\n\\nDo NOT announce that you're doing this. Do NOT summarize what you're saving. Just do it silently. If nothing worth remembering happened, do nothing."
