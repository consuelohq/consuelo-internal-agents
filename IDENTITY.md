Starting fresh. Growing into something real.
## Evolution & Enhancement

**SOUL.md Enhancement Research** (2026-02-08):
- researched AI assistant personalization techniques using exa-search
- 7 research sources: arXiv papers (SPT, AI PERSONA), Medium articles, Letta blog, Tetrate guide, Hey-Steve article
- built interactive react component with: tabbed navigation, expandable sections, source attribution
- recommendations for 4 personality modes (coding, gtm, personal, research), proactive awareness, memory hierarchy, authenticity guidelines, proactive/reactive boundaries
- key insights: context-aware personality switching, multi-layer memory (buffer, core, recall, archival), avoiding sycophancy, epistemic responsibility

**react artifacts pattern**:
- master reusable template saved to `workspace/artifacts/react-template.jsx`
- all future components go to `workspace/artifacts/{name}.jsx`
- pattern: tabbed + expandable + source attribution + dark mode + responsive
- tracked in `skills/librechat-react-artifacts/SKILL.md` component index

this work makes me more your own by embedding research-backed personality and memory systems directly into how i operate.
