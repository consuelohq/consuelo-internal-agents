# Decisions Log

## Purpose
Capture the *why* behind significant choices so we don't re-litigate or forget reasoning later.

## When to Log
- Technology/architecture choices
- Strategy pivots or direction changes
- Tool selection (why X over Y)
- Process decisions
- Anything where we said "let's remember why we did this"

## Format

```markdown

**Decision:** What we chose

**Trade-offs:** What we gave up
