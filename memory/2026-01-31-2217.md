assistant: Let me check what's actually configured:
assistant: Found the issue. Your `botToken` is actually a user token:

- **Current:** `xoxp-8328650944913-...` ← **User token** (wrong)
- **Needed:** `xoxb-8328650944913-...` ← **Bot token** (correct)

Adding scopes to the user token won't help. You need a **bot user token**.

## Here's what to do:

### 1. Go to your Slack App

If you have one already, go to: https://api.slack.com/apps

If not, create a new app called "OpenClaw" or "Suelo"

### 2. Add a Bot User

In your Slack App settings:

1. Go to **Basic Information** → scroll down to **App-Level Tokens** (this is NOT what you want)
2. Instead, go to **OAuth & Permissions** on the left
3. Scroll to **Scopes** → **Bot Token Scopes**
4. Add these scopes:
   - `chat:write`
   - `channels:history`
   - `groups:history`
   - `im:history`
   - `mpim:history`

### 3. Install to Your Workspace

1. Scroll to top of **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Click **Install to Workspace**
3. Authorize the app
4. **Copy the Bot User OAuth Token** — it starts with `xoxb-...`

### 4. Update the Config

Once you have the `xoxb-...` token, run:

```bash
openclaw channels add --channel slack
```

It will prompt you for the bot token. Paste the `xoxb-...` one.

---

**Quick test:** Paste your new bot token here and I can update the config for you.
user: and thats already in the xox stuff
[message_id: ef5e45d4-c769-4e66-8dd5-06d58c5d5cdc]
assistant: Got it — so you have a bot token (`xoxb-...`) but the config is still using the user token (`xoxp-...`).

Can you paste your `xoxb-...` bot token here? I'll update the config directly.
user: [REDACTED_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN] and [REDACTED_SLACK_USER_TOKEN]
[message_id: 14787400-1c79-4553-bb36-3e421e1f6df9]
user: okay so now what?
[message_id: 94b77b1d-aa61-451c-85e3-fa775693d8a5]
assistant: Progress! Now we're getting "not_in_channel" — which means the bot token works, but I need to be invited to the channel first.

**Invite me to #suelo:**

In your Slack channel, run:

```
/invite @Suelo
```

Or in the channel settings, add the app/bot user to the channel.

Once you invite me, I'll be able to reply there directly.
user: so i tagged you and you didnt say anything
[message_id: 592125ca-7db2-428f-8bdd-ead775f450a4]
assistant: Let me check if the bot is even receiving your Slack message:
assistant: I see the issue now. When you tagged me in Slack, the message **didn't come through to OpenClaw** — I only see your messages coming from the web chat.

**The problem:** Just tagging `@Suelo` in the channel doesn't add the bot to the channel. The bot needs to be explicitly invited.

**Also:** Your bot might not actually be named "Suelo" — that's just what I call myself in my identity file. The actual Slack app probably has a different name.

## Here's what to do:

### 1. Find your bot's actual username

In Slack, check what the app is actually called. It might be:
- "OpenClaw"
- "Suelo Bot" 
- Something else you named it when creating the app

### 2. Invite the bot to #suelo channel

In the channel, run:
```
/invite @OpenClaw
```
(Replace with whatever the bot's actual username is)

Or go to **Channel Settings** → **Integrations** → **Add apps** → Find your app

### 3. Test by messaging directly

After inviting, try messaging the bot directly in a DM:
```
@OpenClaw ping
```

Can you tell me what your Slack app is actually named in Slack? That way I can guide you on the exact command to invite it.
user: no inviting suelo worked it says youre in the channel now but after that i tagged you and you didnt say anything
[message_id: 93268c31-5e39-4d4c-907a-3c641512ef00]
assistant: Let me check if there are any incoming Slack events:
assistant: The logs aren't showing any incoming Slack events from #suelo. Let me check if the Slack connection is actually working:
assistant: The bot token works - I can see it's connected to your "Consuelo" workspace. The bot's name is actually "suelo2" (bot ID: B0ABRQE5V9V9V).

The issue is that Slack events aren't reaching OpenClaw. Let me check if your Slack app has the correct event subscriptions enabled:

**Go to your Slack App settings:**

1. Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click on your "Suelo" (or "OpenClaw") app
3. Go to **Event Subscriptions**
4. Make sure these are enabled:
   - `message.channels` - for channel messages
   - `app_mention` - for @mentions
   - `reaction_added` - for reactions (optional)

5. **Save changes** and reinstall/reinstall the app to your workspace

After updating the event subscriptions, the bot should start receiving messages from the channel.

Can you check the app's event subscriptions and let me know which ones are enabled?
