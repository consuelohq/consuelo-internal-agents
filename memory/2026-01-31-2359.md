assistant: Hi Ko! What would you like to work on today? 🌱
user: okay so why cant i acces this accross my tailscale devices rn? http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat?session=agent:main:main
[message_id: 47d07257-2398-404f-88c9-28e45d6e7e0d]
assistant: Because `127.0.0.1` is localhost — it only works on the machine it's running on.

To access it across Tailscale, you need to use your machine's Tailscale IP instead (the `100.x.x.x` address). Run `tailscale ip -4` on the host machine to get the Tailscale IP, then use `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/chat?session=agent:main:main` from other devices.
user: okay run it

assistant: Your Tailscale IP is `100.112.173.49`. 

Use this URL from any device on your tailnet: `http://100.112.173.49:18789/chat?session=agent:main:main`
user: its still saying could not connect
[message_id: d2ab7ad0-bb6d-454e-b331-658769ed76c5]
assistant: The gateway is bound to `loopback` (127.0.0.1 only). I need to change it to bind to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) so it's accessible via Tailscale.
