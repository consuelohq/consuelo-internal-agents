# What Worked Today - Event Rental Research

## Task
User needed event rental pricing research for a medical conference (300 attendees, tables/linens/poster stands). Required complete pricing breakdown and Google Drive upload.

## Workflow That Worked

### 1. Research Phase
- Used web_search for industry pricing (table rentals, linen costs, easel pricing)
- Used web_fetch to get specific company details from Party Reflections website
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for accurate pricing ranges

### 2. Calculations
- 300 people ÷ 2.4 per table = ~125 tables (8ft classroom style)
- Broke down costs: tables, chairs, linens, poster stands, delivery/setup
- Provided low/high estimates based on industry standards

### 3. File Creation & Upload (This Was The Key)
**Step 1: Create local file**
```bash
write file to /Users/kokayi/.openclaw/workspace/event_brief_detailed.md
```

**Step 2: Upload to Google Drive**
```bash
cd /Users/kokayi/.openclaw/workspace && gog drive upload event_brief_detailed.md --name "Event Rental Brief - COMPLETE with Pricing - Brachial Plexus Conference"
```

**Step 3: Share the file (CRITICAL STEP)**
```bash
gog drive share <fileId> --anyone --role reader
```

**Step 4: Create Google Sheets version** (User prefers this format)
- Created CSV with pricing breakdown
- Uploaded as CSV → converts to Google Sheets automatically
- Shared same way

### 4. Key Commands to Remember
```bash
# Upload file
gog drive upload <localFile> --name "Display Name"

# Share with anyone
gog drive share <fileId> --anyone --role reader

# Get file URL
gog drive url <fileId>
```

### 5. User Preferences Learned
- Prefers Google Sheets for pricing/data (easier to work with than markdown)
- Wants complete research done for them (don't make them do the legwork)
- All lowercase communication style
- Wants files in Google Drive, not just local

## Output Files Created
1. Markdown brief: Event Rental Brief - COMPLETE with Pricing - Brachial Plexus Conference
2. CSV/Sheet: Event Rental Pricing - Brachial Plexus Conference

## Total Research Time
~15 minutes from request to final delivery
