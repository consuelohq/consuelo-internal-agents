assistant: hey ko! what's on your mind today?
user: can you turn this into a skill and remeber to use it when i ask you to create linear tasks for coding --- name: task-creator description: Create Linear issues for agent workflows and add them to Mercury project. Auto-detects complexity to create full specs or quick tasks. Supports priority levels. Triggers on /task-creator. --- # Task Creator Create Linear issues for the `.agent/run-tasks.sh` workflow with intelligent complexity detection. Automatically chooses between detailed specification issues and lightweight quick tasks. **Issues are automatically added to the Linear Mercury project** for agent pickup. ## Prerequisites Linear workspace IDs are hardcoded for the consuelo workspace: - Team ID: `29f5c661-da6c-4bfb-bd48-815a006ccaac` - Claude label ID: `b3c52ecf-d35a-4ccd-a305-c288f033c01f` - Mercury project ID: `10004248-b69d-4a76-825a-83d5628571c8` To verify Linear API connection: ```bash source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_check_connection ``` ## Two Modes ### 1. Full Spec Issues (Complex Tasks) Comprehensive GitHub Issues with detailed requirements, design considerations, and task breakdowns. Used for features, multi-file changes, and architectural work. ### 2. Quick Issues (Simple Tasks) Lightweight GitHub Issues for bug fixes, typos, and single-file changes. --- ## Complexity Detection **Analyze the user's request to determine complexity:** ### FULL SPEC indicators (default when ambiguous): - Keywords: "implement", "build", "create", "add feature", "new system", "design" - Multiple components or files involved - API + frontend work together - Database/schema changes - User explicitly says "spec", "detailed", "full", "comprehensive" - Architecture decisions required - New endpoints or routes - State management changes ### QUICK ISSUE indicators: - Keywords: "fix", "bug", "tweak", "typo", "simple", "quick", "minor" - Single file changes - Text/copy updates - Style/CSS adjustments - User explicitly says "quick", "simple", "small" - Clear, bounded scope with obvious implementation ### Manual Override: - `--quick` flag forces quick issue mode - `--full` flag forces full spec mode --- ## Full Spec Format For complex tasks, create a GitHub Issue with this structure: ### Title Format ``` [TYPE]: Brief, actionable description ``` ### Body Format ```markdown ## Overview **Problem Statement:** [Clear description of what's broken or missing] **Why This Matters:** [Business/technical justification - user impact, revenue, technical debt] **Current State:** [How things work now, including limitations] **Desired State:** [How things should work after implementation] --- ## Requirements ### Requirement 1: [Core Functionality Title] **User Story:** As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. WHEN [trigger] THE System SHALL [action] 2. IF [condition] THEN THE System SHALL [response] 3. THE System SHALL [always-on requirement] 4. THE [Component] SHALL [render/display/update] [specific behavior] 5. WHEN [error scenario] THE System SHALL [error handling behavior] ### Requirement 2: Error Handling **User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages, so that I can understand and recover from problems. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. WHEN [error occurs] THE System SHALL [display user-friendly message] 2. THE System SHALL [log error to Sentry with category tag] 3. THE System SHALL [preserve user data/state despite error] ### Requirement 3: Performance **User Story:** As a user, I want fast response, so that my workflow isn't interrupted. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. THE System SHALL [complete operation in <X seconds] 2. THE System SHALL [show loading state after 200ms] --- ## Design ### Architecture [Component hierarchy, data flow diagram] ``` ParentComponent ├── ChildComponent1 │ └── API Call → /api/endpoint └── ChildComponent2 ``` ### Key Files - `path/to/file1.tsx` - [what changes] - `path/to/file2.py` - [what changes] ### Data Models ```typescript interface NewFeatureData { id: string; userId: string; // ... relevant fields } ``` ### Implementation Notes [Any technical considerations, patterns to follow, gotchas to avoid] --- ## Tasks - [ ] Task 1: [Description] (Req 1.1, 1.2) - [ ] Task 2: [Description] (Req 1.3) - [ ] Task 3: [Description] (Req 2.1) - [ ] Task 4: Write tests - [ ] Task 5: Update documentation (if needed) ``` --- ## Quick Issue Format For simple tasks, create a lightweight GitHub Issue: ### Title Format ``` [TYPE]: Brief, actionable description ``` ### Body Format ```markdown **PURPOSE:** What needs to be done and why (1-2 sentences) **KEY FILES:** (if known) - path/to/likely/file.tsx **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:** - [ ] Clear, testable criterion 1 - [ ] Clear, testable criterion 2 - [ ] Clear, testable criterion 3 ``` --- ## Type Prefixes | Type | Use When | |------|----------| | `[FEATURE]` | "add", "create", "implement", "new" | | `[BUG]` | "fix", "broken", "error", "bug", "issue" | | `[REFACTOR]` | "refactor", "restructure", "reorganize", "clean up" | | `[TASK]` | "update", "change", "cleanup", "docs", general work | --- ## Instructions When the user invokes `/task-creator`, follow these steps: ### Step 1: Parse User Input Extract from the user's description: - **What** needs to be done (the core task) - **Why** it matters (if provided) - **Where** it might live (file hints if mentioned) - **Type** of work (feature, bug, task, refactor) - **Complexity** signals (keywords, scope, components involved) ### Step 2: Determine Mode 1. Check for explicit flags (`--quick`, `--full`) 2. If no flags, analyze complexity indicators 3. **When ambiguous, default to FULL SPEC** (better to over-specify than under-specify) ### Step 3: Research (Full Spec Only) For full specs, briefly explore the codebase to identify: - Relevant existing files and patterns - API routes that might be affected - Database collections involved - Similar features to reference ### Step 4: Generate Issue Content **For Full Spec:** - Write comprehensive Overview section - Create 3-5 requirements with acceptance criteria - Include architecture/design section - Break down into specific tasks - Reference actual file paths when possible **For Quick Issue:** - Write concise PURPOSE statement - List KEY FILES if identifiable - Create 3-5 acceptance criteria checkboxes ### Step 5: Create the Linear Issue **Source Linear API and config:** ```bash SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/../.." source "$SCRIPT_DIR/.agent/config.sh" source "$SCRIPT_DIR/.agent/linear-api.sh" ``` **Set Linear IDs (hardcoded for consuelo workspace):** ```bash # Linear workspace IDs for consuelo export LINEAR_TEAM_ID="29f5c661-da6c-4bfb-bd48-815a006ccaac" export LINEAR_LABEL_CLAUDE_ID="b3c52ecf-d35a-4ccd-a305-c288f033c01f" export LINEAR_PROJECT_MERCURY_ID="10004248-b69d-4a76-825a-83d5628571c8" ``` **Parse priority flag (if provided):** ```bash # Check for --priority flag in user's request PRIORITY=0 # Default: no priority if [[ "$USER_REQUEST" == *"--priority urgent"* ]]; then PRIORITY=1 elif [[ "$USER_REQUEST" == *"--priority high"* ]]; then PRIORITY=2 elif [[ "$USER_REQUEST" == *"--priority medium"* ]]; then PRIORITY=3 elif [[ "$USER_REQUEST" == *"--priority low"* ]]; then PRIORITY=4 fi ``` **Create the issue:** ```bash # Build issue body (Full Spec or Quick Issue format - same as before) ISSUE_BODY=$(cat <<'EOF' [Full spec or quick issue markdown content here] EOF ) # Create Linear issue RESULT=$(linear_create_issue "[TYPE]: Title here" "$ISSUE_BODY" "$PRIORITY") # Check for success if ! echo "$RESULT" | jq -e '.data.issueCreate.success' > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo "ERROR: Failed to create Linear issue" echo "$RESULT" | jq '.errors' exit 1 fi # Extract issue details ISSUE_ID=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.id') ISSUE_IDENTIFIER=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.identifier') ISSUE_URL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.url') ``` **Labels:** Linear issues are automatically tagged with the "claude" label. No need for additional label commands. **Project:** issues are automatically added to Mercury project. No additional API call needed. ### Step 6: Confirm to User Show the user: - Issue identifier created (e.g., `DEV-123`) - Title - Mode used (Full Spec or Quick Issue) - Priority (if set) - Project: Added to Mercury project - Linear URL (clickable) - Key acceptance criteria summary **Example confirmation:** ``` Created Linear issue DEV-456 (Full Spec, Priority: High) Title: [FEATURE]: Implement user authentication with email/password and Google OAuth Added to Mercury project View: https://linear.app/your-workspace/issue/DEV-456 Key acceptance criteria: - Email/password account creation with validation - Google OAuth integration - Email verification flow - Rate limiting on failed logins - Comprehensive error handling The agent will pick this up automatically from Linear. ``` --- ## Examples ### Example 1: Full Spec (Complex Feature) **User:** `/task-creator` implement user authentication flow with email/password and Google OAuth **You detect:** "implement", "authentication", multiple components, API + frontend = **FULL SPEC** **You run:** ```bash # Source Linear API source .agent/linear-api.sh source .agent/config.sh # Build issue body ISSUE_BODY=$(cat <<'EOF' ## Overview **Problem Statement:** Users cannot currently create accounts or sign in to the application. **Why This Matters:** Authentication is required for personalized features, data persistence, and security. **Current State:** No authentication system exists. All users share the same anonymous session. **Desired State:** Users can create accounts with email/password or Google OAuth, sign in, and have their data persisted across sessions. --- ## Requirements ### Requirement 1: Email/Password Authentication **User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password, so that I can access personalized features. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. WHEN user submits valid email and password THE System SHALL create a new account 2. THE System SHALL validate email format and password strength (min 8 chars, 1 number, 1 special) 3. IF email already exists THEN THE System SHALL display "Email already registered" error 4. THE System SHALL send email verification link 5. WHEN user clicks verification link THE System SHALL mark account as verified ### Requirement 2: Google OAuth **User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with Google, so that I can access the app without creating a new password. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. WHEN user clicks "Sign in with Google" THE System SHALL redirect to Google OAuth flow 2. THE System SHALL create account if first-time Google user 3. THE System SHALL link Google account to existing email account if same email 4. IF OAuth fails THEN THE System SHALL display user-friendly error message ### Requirement 3: Error Handling **User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when authentication fails. #### Acceptance Criteria 1. WHEN authentication fails THE System SHALL display specific error message 2. THE System SHALL log authentication errors to Sentry with 'auth-api' category 3. THE System SHALL rate-limit failed login attempts (5 per minute) --- ## Design ### Architecture ``` SignInPage ├── EmailPasswordForm → POST /api/auth/login ├── GoogleOAuthButton → /api/auth/google └── CreateAccountLink → SignUpPage └── SignUpForm → POST /api/auth/register ``` ### Key Files - `src/pages/SignIn.tsx` - New sign-in page - `src/pages/SignUp.tsx` - New sign-up page - `app/script.py` - Auth routes (/api/auth/*) - `src/services/api.ts` - Auth API methods ### Data Models ```typescript interface User { id: string; email: string; emailVerified: boolean; passwordHash?: string; googleId?: string; createdAt: string; } ``` --- ## Tasks - [ ] Create MongoDB users collection with indexes (Req 1.1) - [ ] Implement POST /api/auth/register endpoint (Req 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) - [ ] Implement POST /api/auth/login endpoint (Req 1.1) - [ ] Implement email verification flow (Req 1.4, 1.5) - [ ] Set up Google OAuth configuration (Req 2.1) - [ ] Implement /api/auth/google endpoint (Req 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) - [ ] Create SignIn page component (Req 1, 2) - [ ] Create SignUp page component (Req 1) - [ ] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints (Req 3.3) - [ ] Add Sentry error tracking (Req 3.2) - [ ] Write unit tests for auth routes EOF ) # Create Linear issue RESULT=$(linear_create_issue "[FEATURE]: Implement user authentication with email/password and Google OAuth" "$ISSUE_BODY" 0) # Extract details ISSUE_IDENTIFIER=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.identifier') ISSUE_URL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.url') ``` **You respond:** Created Linear issue DEV-456 (Full Spec). This comprehensive authentication implementation covers email/password and Google OAuth with 11 implementation tasks. Added to Mercury project. The agent will pick this up automatically. View: https://linear.app/your-workspace/issue/DEV-456 --- ### Example 2: Quick Issue (Simple Bug Fix) **User:** `/task-creator --quick` fix the typo in the header - it says "Consuello" instead of "Consuelo" **You detect:** `--quick` flag, "fix", "typo", single change = **QUICK ISSUE** **You run:** ```bash # Source Linear API source .agent/linear-api.sh source .agent/config.sh # Build issue body ISSUE_BODY=$(cat <<'EOF' **PURPOSE:** Fix spelling error in the application header. The company name is misspelled as "Consuello" instead of "Consuelo". **KEY FILES:** - src/App.tsx (header component) - src/components/Header.tsx (if separate) **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:** - [ ] Header displays "Consuelo" correctly - [ ] All instances of "Consuello" are corrected - [ ] No other text is affected EOF ) # Create Linear issue (no priority) RESULT=$(linear_create_issue "[BUG]: Fix typo in header - 'Consuello' should be 'Consuelo'" "$ISSUE_BODY" 0) # Extract details ISSUE_IDENTIFIER=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.identifier') ISSUE_URL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.data.issueCreate.issue.url') ``` **You respond:** Created quick issue DEV-457. Simple typo fix in the header. Added to Mercury project. View: https://linear.app/your-workspace/issue/DEV-457 --- ### Example 3: Auto-Detect Full Spec **User:** `/task-creator` add PDF export for call transcripts **You detect:** "add", "export", involves API + frontend, file generation = **FULL SPEC** **You run:** Create full spec with requirements for PDF generation, file download, error handling, and performance considerations. --- ### Example 4: Auto-Detect Quick Issue **User:** `/task-creator` update the copyright year in the footer to 2025 **You detect:** "update", single text change, obvious implementation = **QUICK ISSUE** **You run:** Create quick issue with PURPOSE, KEY FILES (footer component), and 2-3 acceptance criteria. --- ### Example 5: User is Vague **User:** `/task-creator` something with the chat **You ask:** Could you clarify what you'd like to do with the chat? For example: - Add a new feature (reactions, typing indicators, file sharing)? - Fix a bug (messages not sending, display issues)? - Refactor existing code? --- ### Example 6: Batch Tasks **User:** `/task-creator` I need three tasks: 1) Add loading spinner to queue list, 2) Fix the 500 error on file upload, 3) Refactor the auth middleware **You create three separate issues:** 1. Quick issue for loading spinner (single component, UI-only) 2. Quick issue for 500 error fix (bug fix) 3. Full spec for auth middleware refactor (architectural change, affects multiple routes) --- ## Integration with Agent Workflow Issues created by this skill are designed for `.agent/run-tasks.sh` with Linear integration. ### Linear Workflow 1. **Task created**: Issue created in Linear with "claude" label, "Open" state, added to Mercury project (if configured) 2. **Agent picks up task**: `.agent/run-tasks.sh` queries Linear for issues with "claude" label + "Open" state 3. **Agent marks in-progress**: State changes to "In Progress" 4. **Agent follows RPI workflow**: - **Research**: Reads codebase, finds actual files - **Plan**: Creates detailed implementation steps - **Implement**: Writes code, runs tests, commits 5. **Agent completes**: State changes to "In Review" (human reviews and moves to "Done") ### Workflow State Mapping | Linear State | Agent Status | Description | |-------------|--------------|-------------| | `Open` + "claude" label | Ready for pickup | Agent queries this state for new tasks | | `In Progress` | Working | Agent is currently processing | | `In Review` | Awaiting human review | Agent finished, quality gates passed or failed | | `Done` | Completed | Human approved and closed (agent never moves here) | ### Linear Label Reference | Label | Meaning | |-------|---------| | `claude` | Ready for agent pickup (automatically added by task-creator) | ### Priority Levels (Optional) When using `--priority` flag: | Priority | Linear Value | When to Use | |----------|-------------|-------------| | `urgent` | 1 | Critical bugs, production down, security issues | | `high` | 2 | Important features, major bugs affecting users | | `medium` | 3 | Standard features, minor bugs | | `low` | 4 | Nice-to-haves, future improvements | **Note:** Priority doesn't affect agent pickup order (always processes oldest first by `createdAt`). --- ## Best Practices 1. **When in doubt, use Full Spec** - Over-specification is better than under-specification 2. **Be specific in acceptance criteria** - Each criterion should be verifiable as done/not done 3. **Reference actual files when possible** - Helps agent during research phase 4. **One concept per issue** - Split "add feature + refactor auth" into two issues 5. **Keep quick issues truly quick** - If it needs more than 3-5 acceptance criteria, use full spec 6. **Include error handling** - Even quick issues should consider failure cases --- ## Useful Commands ```bash # Check Linear API connection source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_check_connection # View ready issues in Linear source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_get_ready_issues # Get Linear label and project IDs (one-time setup) source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_setup_cache # View team info source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_get_teams # View workflow states source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_get_team_states "$LINEAR_TEAM_ID" # View team labels source .agent/linear-api.sh linear_get_team_labels "$LINEAR_TEAM_ID" # Run the agent workflow (Linear mode) .agent/run-tasks.sh --source linear # Preview Linear issues without processing .agent/run-tasks.sh --source linear --dry-run # Open Linear workspace in browser open "https://linear.app/your-workspace" ```

assistant: I'll turn this into a skill for you. Let me read the skill-creator instructions first, then set it up.
assistant: done! created the task-creator skill and packaged it. added it to memory - i'll use it automatically when you ask me to create linear tasks for coding.
user: Okay, cool. Thank you. Do you have access to edit this open claw Dashboard that I'm looking at right now. Like do we have access to that or like how does that work? Where's that at?
[message_id: aeee7546-8d81-4e87-8707-d29693bf099a]
assistant: i don't have direct access to edit the openclaw dashboard itself - that's part of the openclaw application code/ui, not something in your workspace i can modify.

what i **can** do:
- update openclaw config (via the gateway tool)
- restart the gateway to apply changes
- check on openclaw's status and logs

if you're looking at the dashboard via web browser, that's being served by the openclaw gateway. the dashboard source code lives in the openclaw installation at `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/` - but editing that would be modifying the openclaw package itself, which i wouldn't recommend unless you know what you're doing.

what specifically are you trying to change on the dashboard? maybe there's a config way to do it instead.
user: System: [2026-01-31 19:14:04 EST] 🌙 evening check-in ko!

**personal:**
- did you get some movement on the habits you're working on? (drinking, etc.)
- anything you want to remember for tomorrow?

**personalized note:** you said you're a "really smart dumb person" who needs reminders. that's literally what i'm here for - no judgment, just help.

anything you need from me tonight or for tomorrow morning?

im trying to change the name and the logo in the top left
[message_id: 36fb337c-d9d0-49e6-8ecf-be0b30a909ea]
assistant: let me explore the openclaw installation to find where the dashboard name and logo are configured.
assistant: found it! the openclaw config has a `ui` section that lets you customize the branding. here are the options:

- **`ui.assistant.name`** - the assistant name (max 50 characters)
- **`ui.assistant.avatar`** - the assistant avatar (max 200 characters; can be a file path, URL, or data URI)
- **`ui.seamColor`** - accent color (hex color code like `#FF5733`)

want me to add these to your config? tell me:
1. what name you want in the top left
2. what logo you want (can be a url or local file path)
user: yes name it suelo i added a logo.svg in my .openclaw folder you can see and the color is fine
[message_id: 2ed9c035-a4c3-4ffa-81c5-f5459a30ca94]
assistant: done! updated your config with:
- name: **suelo**
- avatar: your logo.svg file

the gateway is restarting now. refresh the dashboard in a couple seconds and you should see the new name and logo in the top left.

assistant: the file has a space in the name which might be causing issues. also, the dashboard might expect a different format. let me try a couple of things:
