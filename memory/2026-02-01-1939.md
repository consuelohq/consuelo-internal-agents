**key findings:**

- **nooks** — clear leader, $70m raised, 4x growth, kleiner perkins backing. their ai coaching assistant + virtual salesfloor is directly adjacent to consuelo. customers saying reps would quit without it — strong product-market fit.

- **readymode** — launched spam flag protection (autopilot) in may. solid in traditional predictive dialing but not an ai-native play.

- **wavv** — focused on gohighlevel integration. some user complaints about declining call quality (pickup rates dropping).

- **ringy** — budget option, users complain about limited features and support.

nooks is the one to watch — they're building the closest thing to what you're doing with consuelo.
System: [2026-02-01 13:02:04 EST] Cron (error): done — research completed and sent to #suelo.

**summary:**
- topic: insurance sales ai tools (day 1-3 of rotation)
- mode: web-only (no api keys configured for reddit/x)
- key insight: speed-to-lead is the critical factor — 78% of buyers go with the first responder, which validates the real-time coaching approach consuelo is building

next rotation in 3 days will cover "sales coaching software trends."
